Project Title: Bitcoin Blockchain SCR-20 NFT Asset Creation 

Project Plan:

1. Introduction:
This small personal project aims to provide users with the ability to mint and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain using the protocol SRC-20
The project's primary focus is to offer a low-cost solution by creating three unique NFT assets, each deployed 300 times with only 250 available for purchase. 
The availability and low initial price ensure that users can practice this new technology without spending much investment in the asset itself
Main costs are the standard bitcoin fees.

2. Project Objectives:
a. Share existing scattered information how to use dispensers, send and receive NFT. 
b. Create three distinct NFT assets, each with 300 deployments, but only 250 available for purchase. 
c. Establish a pricing model that covers fee costs during asset creation while maintaining a low entry price.
d. Foster a community of NFT enthusiasts and collectors.
e. Ensure the security and immutability of NFT assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.

3. Implementation Steps:
a. Platform Development:
   i. Design and develop a web-based platform that allows users to create and manage their NFT assets.
   ii. Integrate a Bitcoin wallet solution to enable secure transactions and ownership verification.
   iii. Implement a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls for minting, trading, and displaying NFT assets.

b. NFT Asset Creation:
   i. Create three unique NFT asset designs, ensuring distinct visual and thematic elements for each.
   ii. Develop smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain for the deployment and management of NFT assets.
   iii. Configure the smart contracts to limit the availability of each asset to 250 units.

c. Pricing and Fee Coverage:
   i. Conduct thorough market research to determine an optimal initial price for each NFT asset, considering the costs associated with asset creation.
   ii. Set the initial price for each asset at a level that covers fee costs and encourages broader participation.
   iii. Monitor and adjust pricing strategies based on market demand, supply, and user feedback.

d. Community Engagement and Marketing:
   i. Develop a comprehensive marketing plan to attract NFT enthusiasts, collectors, and investors.
   ii. Leverage social media platforms, influencer collaborations, and online communities to create awareness about the project.
   iii. Establish a dedicated community forum or Discord channel to encourage user interaction, feedback, and asset trading.

e. Security and Immutability:
   i. Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to NFT assets.
   ii. Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential risks.
   iii. Ensure the immutability of NFT assets by leveraging the security features inherent in the Bitcoin blockchain.

4. Milestones and Timeline:
The project will be divided into key milestones to ensure efficient execution and timely completion. The estimated timeline for each milestone is as follows:
   - Platform development: 3 months
   - NFT asset creation: 1 month
   - Pricing and fee coverage strategy: 2 weeks
   - Community engagement and marketing: Ongoing
   - Security and immutability measures: Ongoing

5. Conclusion:
